# Internal Documentation

This directory contains internal documentation for agent handoffs, documentation meta-work, and process documentation that supports the development workflow but is not directly related to the codebase itself.

## Documents

### [AGENT_HANDOFF_BRIEFING.md](./AGENT_HANDOFF_BRIEFING.md)
Briefing document for handing off the project between AI agents or developers. Contains context about the project state, recent work, and what needs to be done next.

### [DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md](./DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md)
Summary of how the documentation is organized across the project. Describes the structure of the `docs/` directory and the purpose of each section.

### [DOCUMENTATION_PACKAGE_SUMMARY.md](./DOCUMENTATION_PACKAGE_SUMMARY.md)
Overview of the complete documentation package created for the Unity Collective project. Lists all documentation files and their purposes.

### [FEATURE_DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](./FEATURE_DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
Summary of the feature documentation system. Explains how feature documentation is structured and how to create new feature docs.

### [DOCS_README_ANALYSIS.md](./DOCS_README_ANALYSIS.md)
Analysis of the documentation README files and their effectiveness. Includes recommendations for improving documentation discoverability.

## Purpose

Internal documentation serves several purposes:

**Agent Handoffs**: When transitioning work between AI agents or human developers, these documents provide essential context about what has been done, what's in progress, and what needs attention.

**Process Documentation**: Documents that describe how documentation itself is organized and maintained, creating a meta-layer that helps keep the project documentation consistent and well-structured.

**Historical Context**: Records of decisions made, approaches taken, and lessons learned during the development process that may not fit into feature or technical documentation but are valuable for understanding the project's evolution.
